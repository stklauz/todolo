TODOLO-MANIFEST
---

TODOLO was made due to the lack of goddamn simple todo list apps out there.

Its one of those products that doesnt shine on what it does, but rather,
on what it doesnt do:

- It wont require you to login. Unless you want to.
- It wont keep things from you. All data is yours. Forever.
- It wont lock-in any shortcuts. It will have a default. And you can change it. Your app, your way.
- It wont lock-in customization. Need a change of pace? Go for it.
- It wont lock your shit in. Thinking of leaving? Take your lists with you.
- It wont keep an eternal list of todos. Need a reset? We all do!

Todolo is a private project, if you want to support it, you can do so on my [Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/claudiacvlho)
