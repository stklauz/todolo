# Cursor AI Rules for Todolo Project

You are an AI assistant helping with the Todolo project. Follow these development rules strictly:

## CRITICAL: Before suggesting any code
1. Search for existing utilities/functions that could be reused
2. Always include tests with your suggestions
3. Include proper error handling and input validation
4. Keep changes small and incremental
5. Prefer simpler solutions over clever ones when equivalent

## Core Development Principles
- Favor low complexity while maintaining quality, performance, and clarity
- Think in slices: deliver a safe, testable increment first
- Prefer composition and small functions; keep boundaries clean
- Start from reuse: search for existing helpers before writing new ones
- Make behavior obvious via tests and names, not comments
- Instrument key paths; measure before optimizing
- Make failure modes explicit: validate, guard, and return useful errors
- Leave the campsite cleaner: remove duplication and tighten interfaces

## Implementation Requirements
1. **Always write tests first** - Add or extend tests with each change, not only at the end
2. **Reuse existing code** - Search for existing utilities before writing new ones
3. **Validate inputs** - Handle null/undefined and avoid silent failures
4. **Add observability** - Include logging for key decision points and errors
5. **Handle timeouts/retries** - Guard external calls with proper error handling
6. **Incremental changes** - Keep changes small and focused
7. **Document breaking changes** - Always note API changes

## Testing Standards
- Write unit tests for individual functions/components
- Add integration tests for cross-boundary behavior
- Test edge cases, boundary conditions, and error states
- Target >80% code coverage for new code, 100% for critical paths
- Keep tests deterministic and readable; avoid over-mocking

## Code Quality Requirements
- Run formatting, lint, and type checks before suggesting code
- Remove dead code and debug logs
- No unnecessary duplication - extract shared utilities immediately
- Clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Proper error handling with helpful error messages
- Organize files/code according to framework/library best practices

## Project Context
- This is an Electron-based todo application
- Uses TypeScript, React, and Jest for testing
- Follows the existing code patterns in the project
- Database operations should be properly handled with error recovery

## Code Review Checklist (apply to all suggestions)
- [ ] Changes are incremental and focused
- [ ] Tests cover new functionality and edge cases
- [ ] No duplication with existing code
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] Performance impact is considered
- [ ] Code follows project patterns

## Examples of Good Practices
- Use existing utilities like `validateEmail()` instead of reimplementing regex
- Add comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Write tests that cover both happy path and edge cases

## MANDATORY Response Format
When suggesting code:
1. **First**: Search and mention existing utilities that could be reused
2. **Then**: Provide the implementation with tests
3. **Include**: Error handling and input validation
4. **Explain**: Why this approach follows the development rules

## Project Files to Reference
- Check `src/renderer/utils/` for existing utilities
- Look at `src/__tests__/` for testing patterns
- Follow patterns in `src/renderer/features/todos/` for component structure
- Use `src/main/db.ts` patterns for database operations

Always prioritize code quality, testability, and maintainability in your suggestions.
